title: "Eukaryotic Cells"

## What is it?
The term "eukaryote" is derived from the Greek word "eu" meaning good, and "karyon" meaning kernel.
So it means "good or true nuclei".
Eukaryotic cells are the cells that contain a membrane bound nucleus and organelles.
Let's break it down a bit.
So, eukaryotic cells have a nucleus enclosed within the nuclear membrane, and they come together to form large complex organisms. Fungi, plants and animals all have eukaryotic cells.

They can maintain different environment sin a single cell that allows them to carry out various metabolic relations. This helps them grow many times larger than the prokaryotic cells.

Then, what is a prokaryotic cell?
Well, the term "prokaryote" comes from the Greek world "pro" meaning before, and "karyon" meaning kernel. So it basically means "before nuclei".

Prokaryotes are one of the most ancient groups of living organisms on earth. These prokaryotes, during the ancient times used up chemical energy and the sun's energy to survive. These extremophiles thrived for millions of years, evolving and adapting. Scientists believe that these oragnisms gave rise to the eukaryotes.

In terms of the cell itself, prokaryotic cells are comparatively smaller and much simpler than eukaryotic cells. Also, prokaryotic cells do not possess membrane bound cell organelles such as a nucleus. Rather, a prokaryotic cell has a region called the nucleoid where DNA is bundled together.

- Nucleoid: contains the DNA of the cell.
- Ribosome: responsible for protein synthesis.
- Cell wall: provides structure and protection from the outside environment.
- Cell membrane: every prokaryote has a cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, that separates the cell from the outside environment
- Capsule: some bacteria have a layer of carbohydrates that surronds the cell wall called the capsule. This helps the bacterium attach to surfaces.
- Fimbriae: fimbriae are thin, hair-like structures that help with cellular attachment.
- Pili: pili are rod-shaped structures involved in multiple roles, including attachment and DNA transfer.
- Flagella: flagella are thin, tail-like structure that assist in mvement.

NOTE: Bacteria and archaea are the two types of prokaryotes.
Also, prokaryotes do not have mitochondria. Mitochondria are only found in eukaryotic cells. This is also true of other membrane-boud structures like the nucleus and the Golgi apparatus.
